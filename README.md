# Expense-Tracker
The Expense Tracker application helps you manage your finances by keeping track of your income and expenses. You can add and remove transactions, and all data is saved to local storage so you don't lose your information.

Project Specifications
User Interface (UI):

Create a user-friendly interface to interact with the expense tracker.
The UI should allow users to view and manage their transactions easily.
Display Transaction Items:

Show a list of transaction items in the DOM.
Each transaction should include details like amount, description, and type (income or expense).
Financial Totals:

Display the current balance, total income, and total expenses on the UI.
Update these totals dynamically as transactions are added or removed.
Add New Transactions:

Provide a form or input fields to add new transactions.
Upon submission, the transaction should be added to the DOM and reflected in the total balance, income, and expenses.
Delete Transactions:

Allow users to delete transactions from the list.
Ensure the balance and totals are updated accordingly after a transaction is removed.
Local Storage:

Save all transactions and financial data to local storage.
Ensure that data is retrieved and displayed correctly when the application is reloaded.
